(**
 * values are expressions that don't evaluate any further.  With the exception
 * of VClosure and VError, the value constructors are analogous to the Ast.expr
 * constructors.
 *   - VClosure ("x", e, env) represents <<fun x -> e, {env}>>
 *   - VError is used to indicate that evaluation failed for some reason
 *)
type value =
  | VUnit | VInt of int | VBool of bool | VString of string
  | VClosure of var * expr * environment
  | VVariant of constructor * value
  | VPair of value * value
  | VError of string

(**
 * An environment is a mapping of variables to values,
 * represented by an association list.
 *)
and environment = (var * value ref) list

(** [eval] implements the environment model of evaluation.
 * 
 *  [eval env e] returns [v] where
 *    env :: e || v (using the notation from lecture)
 *
 * This function should return VError if the expression is not well formed (e.g.
 * if it contains an unbound variable or a match expression doesn't contain a
 * matching pattern)
